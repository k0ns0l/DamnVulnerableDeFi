# My Web3 Audit Journey 🚀

This repo documents my personal learning path in Web3 security, starting from hands-on experience with common DeFi vulnerabilities

I began with [Damn Vulnerable DeFi](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/) — a great resource for practicing real-world attack scenarios. Challenges are tackled in order, based on directory naming -

Each challenge helped me understand key Web3/DeFi concepts like flash loans, reentrancy, price manipulation, and more. I've included my thought process, exploits, and lessons learned in each folder.

Happy hacking 🛡️
